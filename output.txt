To merge branches in Git, you can use the following command:

git merge [branch_name]

Replace [branch_name] with the name of the branch you want to merge into your current branch.
The stash in Git allows you to temporarily save changes that you have made to your working directory, without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch to a different branch or work on a different task, but don't want to commit your current changes yet. You can later apply the stash and continue working on those changes.
git push origin master
Here are the commands to push `abc.txt` to GitHub:

1. `git add abc.txt`
2. `git commit -m "[Commit Message]"`
3. `git push`

Make sure to replace `[Commit Message]` with a descriptive commit message.
git pull origin master
git merge abc
