Here are the commands to push all your changes to GitHub:

1. `git add .` (to add all changes)
2. `git commit -m "origin"` (to commit changes with the message "origin")
3. `git push` (to push changes to GitHub)

Please make sure you are in the appropriate branch before executing these commands.
git add abc.txt
I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm just a virtual assistant here to help with your git commands. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!
To merge branches in Git, you can use the following command:

git merge [branch_name]

Replace [branch_name] with the name of the branch you want to merge into your current branch.
The stash in Git allows you to temporarily save changes that you have made to your working directory, without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch to a different branch or work on a different task, but don't want to commit your current changes yet. You can later apply the stash and continue working on those changes.
